CSC 260 Object Oriented Final Project
 
This project is based around the idea of organizing an animal shelter with software. In general, there are three types of "environments" that an animal can live in in a shelter: a cage (for mammals, birds, etc.), an aquarium (for fish and aquatic life), and a terrarium (for reptiles, amphibians, etc.). This piece of software keeps track of information for each environment.

Some information that is tracked includes:
  - Last time fed
  - Last time cleaned
  - Number of inhabitants
  - Type of inhabitants
  - Environment ID
  - Water pH level (for aquariums)
  
Furthermore, you can add/remove  based on the population of each environment and can update the last time that the environment was cleaned and the last time that the inhabitants of the environment were fed. Of course you can also add and remove environments.

There are some assumptions that I made while making this program that I felt were necessary to create a usable piece of software:
  - When an environment is created, the time of creation will also be the first time fed and the first time cleaned
  - There is only 1 type of inhabitant that can be assigned per environment (ex: you can't mix turtles with rabbits in the same environment)
  
Overall, I thought that this final project was a success for what I was going for. I learned a lot from making this project and could of course build upon it in the future.
